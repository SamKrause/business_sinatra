    <h4>Tavola Della Famiglia.</h4>
    <p>Here's an old familiar scene that you may remember well. The whole family sitting down to a great home cooked meal at a la tavola della famiglia (the family table)! The photo pictured is our family, cerca 1958. This is a traditional gathering of the Vespers and Gizzio families.  Our great-grandparents, Dominic and Helen (front right), and out great grandfation Frank Vesper, emigrated from Italy in the early 1900's.  Helen, a young Napoletana, from Campania, and Frank Vesper a young boy from L'Aquila, in Abbruzzo, cam to America to make a better life for themselves, and thier future families.</p>
